## What it does
- Downloads selected MDK from [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net)
- Extracts the MDK and replaces mods.toml, domain and class names with selected info
## Why did you make this
Boredom and fed up of having to do setup myself ðŸ˜¬

### Plans to add:
- Fabric possibly?
- Parchment Support
- IDE setup commands auto ran

### Other:
- Found an issue? Report it onto the issue tracker and I'll get round to it eventually.

- Other questions or concerns? Contact me via Discord (AG6#9462)
